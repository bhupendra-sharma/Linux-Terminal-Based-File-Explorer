## Assumptions
>1. **Works better in FULLSCREEN terminal only.**
>2. **If directory path starts with ~ (~/foo.txt) then it is resolved into /home/{user name}/foo.txt**
>3. **If . is present then it is current directory at which we are currently.**
>4. **If it starts with / then that path is considered as path from root (absolute path)**
